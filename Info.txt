What is an Alexa Skill: 
•	Built-in or Custom skills that enables Amazon Alexa devices to respond to a number of different voice commands. 
•	Examples of Built-in skills from Amazon (e.g. play music, provide weather forecasts, query Wikipedia, answer questions)
•	Create Custom skills developed by third parties (USC) and certified by Amazon
•	Enormous storehouse of third-party skills

To build an Alexa Skill you need two platforms, one is Amazon Developer Console and the other is Amazon Web Services.
Amazon Developer Console (Front end of the skill)
•	Where you design the interaction model of the skill - intents, slots and utterances.
Amazon Web Services (Back end of the skill – USC used Amazon's free 'AWS Lambda function')
•	Where you create the functionality of your skill - returns responses to the intents and utterances.
